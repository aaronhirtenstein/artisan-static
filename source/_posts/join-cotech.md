Our vision is a fairer world in which wealth and resources are distributed to the people who need them rather than those best able to take them.

## Why join CoTech?

As an existing worker cooperative there are many reasons why you might want to join the fastest growing UK tech worker coop network. 

## More work and better business

Joining the CoTech network will allow you to: 

* get referrals from other members,
* collaborate or partner on projects,
* supplement your team with skills that you don’t have,
* meet the needs of your own clients.

Being part of a larger network can increase your own reputation as a business and value proposition that will enable you to win work and grow your business.

## More skills and better knowledge 

You can tap into skills and experience from other cooperatives that will enable you to:

* learn about better ways of working and 
* solve common problems
* share your knowledge and experience on various aspects of your work 
* promote your cooperative to potential partners and collaborators.

Sharing skills and knowledge helps us all to be more efficient and reduce the likelihood of duplicating efforts. 

## More support and a better network

You will join a friendly and welcoming network of co-operative businesses and people. We support each other through: 

* regular meetups and workshops,
* peer-to-peer mentoring and shadowing,
* access to private threads on our community forum,
* co-working opportunities,
* a private Slack channel. 

Meeting like minded people is a crucial aspect of building trust and solidarity within the network and will provide a vital support network of like-minded individuals for your co-op.

## Who can join?

**Existing worker coops**

If you are a worker co-op based primarily in the UK that sells digital services then you are eligible to become a member of the network with full voting rights.

There are many types of co-op that are eligible for membership, including worker co-operatives, freelancer co-ops and various types of consortium co-ops.

**Existing tech/digital companies**

If you are part of a company or social enterprise that sells digital services and would be interested in becoming a worker co-op then we’re here to help. You can contact us via our community forum and arrange to talk to a member who is nearby.

Once you’re on the path to becoming a co-op you can become a member of the network.

**Individuals that want to join an existing  tech co-op or start their own**

If you are an individual that would like to work for a tech co-op then you can either apply for a job at an existing member co-op or start your own.

To express an interest in working for a tech co-op you can contact us using the jobs board on our open Discourse forum explaining about your skills/experience and why you want to work for a tech co-op.

**If you would like to start a tech co-op then we’d love to help you.**

Co-operatives in the UK take various legal forms including companies limited by shares, companies limited by guarantee, co-operative and mutual societies, partnerships and unincorporated bodies. All are eligible for membership of Co-operative Technologists.

## How do I join?

There is no fee to join CoTech, but, in order to be eligible, your co-operative must:

* agree with and practise the 7 Co-operative Principles,
* be owned and democratically run by its workers,
* provide tech/digital services.
* be based in or have significant ties to the UK

Your membership is approved by the existing members of CoTech via a proposal on Loomio. If you are interested in joining the network, then simply send an email to contact@coops.tech with a brief description of your co-op and some evidence (e.g. Articles of Association) that answers those principles.

You can find more information about membership on our [wiki](https://wiki.coops.tech/wiki/Main_Page).
